Welcome to my demo app using my colleague's pre-trained model and the bone marrow cell classification kaggle dataset made to:

1. classify a single cell

2. compute a graph (predictions report for all 13 classes)

(We narrowed down the number of classes of the kaggle dataset from 21 to 13 due to class and feature imbalances)
